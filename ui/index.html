    <h1>WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR COMPUTER?</h1>
    <p>Your files are <span>ENCRYPTED.</span> That means they're GONE. You can''t access them. Period.</p>
    <p>Stop wasting your time trying to fix this. <span class="warning">YOU CAN''T.</span> No one can. Not without us.</p>

    <h1>CAN YOU GET YOUR FILES BACK?</h1>
    <p>Yeah, maybe. But you’re on the clock. <span class="warning">TIME’S TICKING.</span></p>
    <p>You can decrypt a few files for free. Want all of them? <span class="warning">PAY UP.</span></p>
    <p>You’ve got <strong>3 days</strong> to pay before the price DOUBLES. After <strong>7 days</strong>, your files are <span class="warning">GONE FOREVER.</span></p>
    <p>Too broke? Tough luck. Maybe in 6 months we’ll throw you a bone.</p>

    <h1>HOW DO YOU PAY?</h1>
